OFX / QFX statement parser.

OFX (Open Financial Exchange) is the machine-readable format exported by most
US and UK banks. It exists in two flavours:
  OFX 1.x — a legacy SGML dialect where leaf elements have no closing tags
             (<CURDEF>USD with no </CURDEF>). Python's XML parser rejects it.
  OFX 2.x — proper XML, parseable directly.

Both are handled transparently by the ofxparse library. This module only deals
with the canonical RawTransaction shape; it doesn't know about PDFs or SQLite.

Key differences from PDF parsers:
- No per-transaction running balance → balance_after is always None.
- No FX breakout: standard OFX carries one amount in the account's own
  currency. Both transaction_currency and settlement_currency are set to the
  account currency (CURDEF). Foreign-currency transactions show only the
  settled amount, not the native amount + rate.
- Reconciliation is partial: OFX provides a LEDGERBAL (point-in-time closing
  balance) but not the opening balance for the period. The reconcile() function
  records the closing balance as the snapshot but cannot verify the full
  opening → sum → closing walk, so is_clean is always False when LEDGERBAL is
  present (marked "unverified" in the dashboard), or True when no LEDGERBAL
  exists (nothing to check).
