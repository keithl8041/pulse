"""
Repositories — the ONLY place SQL strings live in this codebase.

PREVIOUS DESIGN PROBLEM: SQL was scattered as inline strings across
app/main.py (Flask routes) and scripts/ingest_statement.py, with no single
place owning the read/write contract for a table. Adding a column meant
grepping the whole codebase for every place that touched that table.

FIX: one repository class per aggregate (accounts, categories, vendor
rules, transactions, trips, snapshots, review queue). Callers — services
and web routes — depend on these classes, never on raw SQL or a bare
sqlite3.Connection beyond passing it in. This is the one deliberately
"clean architecture" pattern adopted here, and it earns its place: it's
the difference between "where do I add a column" being a one-file answer
or a grep-the-whole-repo answer.

Each repository takes a connection in its constructor rather than opening
its own — this is what makes services.ingestion testable with a single
shared in-memory connection instead of hitting disk, and is what fixed the
N+1 query problem in the original categorizer (which opened a fresh
connection per call).
