# PULSE — Personal Unified Ledger & Spending Engine

> **Fork of [ashik-bekal/pulse](https://github.com/ashik-bekal/pulse)** — extends the original with OFX/QFX and QIF import, smart rule suggestions, vendor rule editing, sub-categories, and review queue UX improvements.

Turn bank statement PDFs (and OFX/QIF exports) into a reconciled, categorized,
multi-currency personal ledger — local-first, SQLite-backed, no cloud, no accounts.

The core discipline: **every statement must tie out exactly** against its own
printed balances. If a parsed month doesn't reconcile to the penny, PULSE says
so instead of silently absorbing the gap — so your ledger is provably complete,
not approximately right.

## Features

- **Statement parsing** for five formats:
  - HSBC UK current accounts (PDF)
  - Chase checking/savings combined statements (PDF, split per account)
  - Chase Sapphire / credit cards (PDF, incl. three-line FX breakouts)
  - **OFX/QFX** — any bank that exports Open Financial Exchange files
  - **QIF** — Quicken Interchange Format, with UK DD/MM/YYYY date handling
- **Exact reconciliation** per statement: opening balance walked through every
  transaction must reproduce each printed checkpoint and the closing balance;
  gaps and unverified periods are surfaced on the dashboard
- **Multi-currency**: native, settled, and reporting (GBP) amounts per
  transaction, with monthly exchange rates
- **Auto-categorization** via vendor rules (contains/exact/regex), with a review
  queue for low-confidence matches
- **Smart rule suggestions**: after resolving a review item the app proposes a
  vendor rule to cover similar open transactions — skipped automatically when
  the item is unique
- **Vendor rule management**: inline edit, approve/reject pending rules, and
  bulk approve/delete from the Vendor Rules page
- **Sub-categories**: categories can have a parent; displayed and grouped as
  "Parent - Child" throughout the UI
- **Quick-add category**: any category dropdown has a "+ new category..." option
  that opens an inline modal without leaving the page
- **Duplicate-safe imports**: re-uploading overlapping statements skips what's
  already present — while same-day repeat purchases are kept
- **Web UI**: dashboard (balances, statement coverage, net worth), transactions
  with filters/bulk actions/running totals, stacked spend-by-category analysis
  with drill-down, trips, and a shared edit modal
- **Async import**: drag-and-drop several statements, auto-detection of format
  and target account by account number, background jobs with per-file
  reconciliation status

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 cli/seed_demo.py        # schema + fictional demo data
python3 web/app.py              # http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

Prefer an empty ledger? `python3 cli/init_db.py` instead of the seed.

Import statements from the UI (Import button) or the CLI:

```bash
python3 cli/ingest.py hsbc /path/to/statement.pdf
python3 cli/ingest.py chase_bank /path/to/statement.pdf --year 2025 --start-month 5
python3 cli/ingest.py sapphire /path/to/statement.pdf --year 2025 --start-month 5
python3 cli/ingest.py ofx /path/to/export.ofx
python3 cli/ingest.py qif /path/to/export.qif
```

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables with safe local defaults — see
[.env.example](.env.example):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PULSE_DB_PATH` | `data/ledger.db` | SQLite location |
| `PULSE_SECRET_KEY` | random per process | Flask secret (set in production) |
| `PULSE_HOST` / `PULSE_PORT` | `127.0.0.1` / `5001` | Dev server bind |
| `PULSE_DEBUG` | `0` | Werkzeug debugger (dev only — it executes code) |
| `PULSE_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `16` | Statement upload cap |
| `PULSE_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging verbosity |

## Security model

PULSE is a **single-user, local-first** app: there is no authentication layer.
It binds to `127.0.0.1` by default and should stay there. If you must reach it
remotely, put it behind a reverse proxy that provides authentication (and TLS),
and set `PULSE_SECRET_KEY`.

Your financial data never leaves your machine: no telemetry, no external calls.
The `.gitignore` blocks databases and statement PDFs from ever being committed.

## Production notes

Run under a WSGI server instead of the dev server:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
PULSE_SECRET_KEY=$(python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))") \
  gunicorn -w 2 -b 127.0.0.1:8000 web.app:app
```

SQLite in WAL mode handles this app's single-user concurrency fine; back up by
copying `data/ledger.db` while the app is idle.

## Architecture

```
parsers/       pure text/OFX/QIF -> RawTransaction converters + per-format reconcile()
domain/        models + categorization engine (pure functions, no I/O)
services/      ingestion (categorize + persist + flag), FX, reconciliation
persistence/   the ONLY place SQL lives (repository per aggregate)
web/           Flask routes + templates; import job queue
cli/           init_db, seed_demo, ingest
tests/         synthetic-fixture suite (no real statements needed)
```

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```
